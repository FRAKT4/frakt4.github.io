        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is inspired by Bulgogi (Korean Barbecue Beef), which is traditionally made with thinly sliced sirloin. This recipe instead uses ground beef to make it a more budget-friendly dish. Using ground beef also saves time, because you donâ€™t need to marinate the meat for hours to allow all the flavors to sink in.</p>
