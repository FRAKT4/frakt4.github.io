        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Curry rice, or kare rice (pronounced  karē raisu), is a dish that was brought to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) from the British, when India was under colonial rule. It was served to the Japanese Imperial Navy to prevent thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and became popular across Japan in the 1960s when curry made its appearance in restaurants and supermarkets.</p>

            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Yellow onion</li>

            <li>Grated ginger</li>
            <li>Fuji apple, grated</li>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp of honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 cups of chicken stock</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Over medium high heat coat the bottom of a medium sized pot (5-6 quart) or large sauté pan with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring often, 4-5 minutes or until softened and beginning to char in spots. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, ginger, and apple. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Next add in the chicken pieces, honey, ketchup and soy sauce and again stir until everything is evenly combined. Pour the chicken stock over the top and bring the mixture to a light simmer.</li>
            <li>Add in the carrots, potatoes and a splash of shiro dashi, if you’d like. Simmer the mixture over medium low heat for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are just cooked through and the chicken has poached.</li>
            <li>Submerge a large ladle in the center of the pot until the ladle fills up with liquid. Add 2-3 squares of curry roux to the center of the ladle and whisk the roux into the liquid until combined. Once the roux is dissolved pour the ladle back into the broth and repeat this step until the curry begins to thicken and coat the back of a spoon, it should have the consistency of a thin gravy. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>To serve, fill one side of a deep bowl with steamed white rice and ladle your curry into the other side. Serve with pickled vegetables if you’d like.</li>
            <li>Season pork generously on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three separate medium sized bowls. To the first bowl add the flour, to the second whisk together 1 egg and water until homogenous, and add panko to the third bowl.</li>
            <li>Coat the pork evenly in the flour, shaking off any excess. Next coat in the egg mixture. Finally generously coat the pork in the breadcrumbs, pressing the panko into the pork to adhere as much as possible.</li>
        </ol>
