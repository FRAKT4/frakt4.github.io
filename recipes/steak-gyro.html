        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces (113g) feta cheese</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>½ cup (140g) low fat Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (14g) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (14g) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ seedless English cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ red onion, thinly sliced and rinsed with cold water</li>
            <li>1 jalapeño, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¾ pound (340g) flank steak</li>
            <li>2 pitas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender add feta, garlic, yogurt, and a splash of water. Blend on high-speed until smooth. Stream in the oil and another splash of water and continue to blend until combined.</li>
            <li>Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl and whisk until homogenous. Season to taste with salt. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>One at a time, place the flank steak on the skillet and sear for 3 minutes. Flip, and sear for an additional 2-3 minutes for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Lightly char the pita over an open flame for about 15 seconds per side.</li>
            <li>Place half of the sliced steak on top of the pita and drizzle with 2 tablespoons feta garlic sauce. Top with the cucumber salad and garnish with parsley, if you’d like.</li>
        </ol>
